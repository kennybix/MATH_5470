In Gaussian processes the main challenge is the definition of valid kernels (covariance functions) able to capture the relationships between different tasks. This paper presents a novel methodology to construct valid multi-task covariance functions (Mercer kernels) for Gaussian processes allowing for a combination of kernels with different forms. The method is based on Fourier analysis and is general for arbitrary stationary covariance functions. Analytical solutions for cross covariance terms between popular forms are provided including Matérn, squared exponential and sparse covariance functions. Experiments are conducted with both artificial and real datasets demonstrating the benefits of the approach. 1},

  title    = {Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms},
  year     = {2011},
  abstract = {In recent years, several methods have been proposed to combine multiple kernels instead of using a
single one. These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may
be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature
subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give
a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on
real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there
may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as
given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of
used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a
single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems
more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels,
whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.

Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) exploits these techniques by deriving approximate kernels with very fast MVMs. Unfortunately, such strategies suffer badly from the curse of dimensionality. We develop a new technique for MVM based learning that exploits product kernel structure. We demonstrate that this technique is broadly applicable, resulting in linear rather than exponential runtime with dimension for SKI, as well as state-of-the-art asymptotic complexity for multi-task GPs.},

Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel), which
are determined by a model selection criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in
their parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which function structure
to choose, for instance to decide between a squared exponential and a rational quadratic kernel.
Based on the principle of approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to
rank kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set coding shows
promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with maximum evidence (also called
marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out cross-validation.},
